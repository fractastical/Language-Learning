Thoughts re: vocabulary loading. Vocabulary should be approached in the following way:

Memorizing misc. basic vocabulary via flashcard system -

Starting with foreign word -> english word, and later making sure that the reverse also holds. Hearing the correct pronunciation is very important and cuing memory to sound is important. Digital systems are much preferred. Start with single exposure with repeating the prononciation once or twice outloud then in one's head several times, then repetition within ten minutes, then repetition next day, then, assuming you still know it, in five days, then in 10 days, etc. This must be done every day or two to be effective. Repetition of word should be done once in context if possible (more important with intermediate words).  

Example: italian-flashcards.com

Memorizing misc vocabulary by type via written repetition - 

Pick a type (numbers, months, days of the week, basic irregular verbs, etc), write down english on one side of paper in a single column, allow columns to be folded, write foreign language word to right of English, when completed a set, fold over and start new column. Repeat mentally twice after each column is written once. Memorize one set per day, review once the same day and once the day after, then review when necessary. 

Conjugations -

Write, memorize, practice. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
