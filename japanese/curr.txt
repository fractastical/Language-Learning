Two private tutors + Berlitz classes, meeting 8x / week, for appx. 8 hrs of class time. Very little formal curriculum w/ Berlitz. More so w/ tutors. Made it through ch. 32 (?) of Minna no Nihongo in 2.5 months, which seemed like reasonable progress, but never resolved visa issue and was forced to relocate, then got very sick and was forced to leave country. Ending in...  failure!
