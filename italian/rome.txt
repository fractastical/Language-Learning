Here I am and I prepare finally to write something of Rome, of this eternal city, of the treasures and challenges I face, many, one, all. I have sat down several times and there have been no words, perhaps because words are no longer needed. What is needed is attention and attention to myself requires somewhat fewer verbal explosions, at least for a moment, although of course there is a place for words. Strange that my guides here should be two, the shadow of a German poet, and more closely, the Russian director. I am preparing again for Nostalgia and expect a firely oration. It is difficult, at times, to be alone, and, though lonely I feel, there is company here in my loneliness. I searched for companions, not any longer.
