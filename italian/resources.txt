Evaluation: Word book near useless compared to flashcards. Reader beginning to be useful as approaching B1 level but not before. Pocket dictionary very useful, inclusive of list of phrases and irregular verbs. Pocket dictionary exclusively in Italian also very useful when writing defintions of new words. Grammar in Italian (O-Key) not useful. Oxford book very useful as a reference but not very for learning new material. SLdV books (L'Italiano dal vivo) of varying quality and only useful as exercises, not for teaching new material. Mamma Mia and Espresso seem comparable as ways of learning the language from scratch. Dummies books are not recommended. Phrase book marginally useful. Grammar book broken down by section and with both explanations and exercises promises to be very useful (Grammatica avanzata, Alma). iPad dictionary is fantastic because more extensive, portable, and faster to look up than paper dictionary. 

If starting from scratch would do these (in order of prority):

Collins Dictionary (iPad app)
Italian Grammar and Verbs (Oxford)
Easy Italian Reader (R. Saggese Digital/Kindle)

Espresso Corso di Italiano (3,B1) p1.28
