Language learning is, to a certain extent, about memory and memorizing. There are multiple levels, the ability to passively recognize something, the ability to use it, and the "depth" at which it is stored (meaning, primarily, the length of time that it will be available. There is, at present, little in the way of an exact science about these things (as far as I know) and I propose that when it comes to retention and depth, some sum of the following four elements is at play: (1) force (2) tool (3) absorptive capacity (4) repetition. For my metaphor I would chose a man attempting to etch hieroglyphics into clay. The most obvious and easiest circumstance exists when the clay itself is soft and wet, then even a light push with a finger or stick will leave a significant result. Indeed, our greatest effort should be that the clay in question (our mind) is as soft and supple as possible, an effort that is supremely helped by immersion and participation in the surrounding culture with which the language exists in reciprocal relationship. This will ideally be a "child mind." However, this does not make attention to the other aspects unimportant. Particularly assuming the mind has hardened a bit (as is usually the case in life) a sharp tool will be important. I use the latest flashcard technology among other things. I increasingly think force that one applies is less important, since, among other things, the application of force produces exhaustion. Better to have sharp tools. Repetition is, to a certain extent, also always necessary. However, various types of repetition can be replaced with others, again depending of the quality of the tools and one's relationship to them. For instance, a single out-loud verbal repetition of a word on a flashcard can be followed with one or two mental echoes, ensuring that the word in question goes to a "deep" space.
