*Language Learning Rubrics*

*Difficulty of a language can be broken into the following categories:*

*Time to learn:* relates to likeness of languages (cognates) between known languages / complexity of grammar / complexity of pronunciation / other complicating factors (i.e. graph based writing system).

*Painfulness of learning:* Painfulness (i.e. non-fun) aspects of learning can elongate the process insofar as perceived pain is likely to result in less resource allocation (e.g. mental attention/hours per day) towards the above. This can diminished in several ways: sadism (seeming favorite of Sanskritists), or developing a taste for unusual aspects of language. In my observation, the best students in Sanskrit class thus far seem to be those who enjoy looking at each sentence as a logic puzzle to be decrypted -- this has not worked for me.
