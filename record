-- observation: difficult to maintain >1000 words. Moving to "multimedia" but hard to review new vocab. Important to move to active vocab, and even more important (at this stage) to be able to rapidly conjugate verbs and use them in sentences. Generally speaking, I have failed to meet my higher objectives and would have ideally been at an active 2000 active vocab instead of the probably 1200 which I currently have. This is, however, extremely difficult to measure esp. given the many many cognates (and things which are not included, like numbers).  Probably need to devise a better system for measuring. Typical pattern: make plan, start with enthusiasm, get diverted (put enthusiasm into related side projects), end up exhausted.

ob: lots of time spend on rapid use of words and, esp. conjugation of verbs. I feel that at least the present, simple past (prossimo), and gerunds I am fairly rapid without many mistakes. I am also usually able to understand basic Italian conversations. I have purchased approximately 12 books in Italian and reviewed several. However, despite an increase in speed, I am not close to being able to keep up with native speakers. The primary limitation seems to be vocabulary, which, despite passive increase (from conversations and, esp. reading) does not include all of the normal necessary verbs and nouns. I think I must be more systematic here, although, as noted, I have not been keeping up with the online flashcard system. Another problem is not knowing what order to approach the grammar in. Although I am able to teach myself and memorize new grammar from the book, it is not always clear what is necessary at my current stage (for example, I memorized gerunds somewhat randomly). As noted to teacher in one-on-one class today, at the Goethe Institute I had the benefit of an orderly curriculum so that I could study the next level while in the current one (something I did), so as to move forward far more quickly than usually possible.
