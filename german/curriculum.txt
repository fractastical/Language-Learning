Study plan (2 months Goethe-Instit Munich (A1-A2), 1 month Goethe-Instit Schwaebiche Halle (B1), 1 month Klartext Munich (B2), 2 Months Deutsch als Fremdsprache at Ludwig Maximillian (C1-C2)). Total six months, passed DSH exam at the end of it, albeit not with particularly high marks (did very well some sections, not so well in writing or speaking -- the latter probably primarily because I was forced to talk about German philosophy in German, a subject for which I was not particularly well prepared).
