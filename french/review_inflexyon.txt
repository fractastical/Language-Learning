This particular school and associated program served needs above adequately, providing within requested parameters teachers according to request. 

Requests set one:

	I am an American currently working on my European languages and, having finished an intensive program of Italian study, would like to learn French. I have already studied French formally and informally, although sadly I never learned how to speak it. Consequently, I would like to spend approximately a month with private lessons in as close to a full-immersion setting as possible.

	 I think I would like to do two 2.5 hours sessions per day, 5 days a week, with the intention of moving through the curriculum as quickly as possible. Ideally this would start at the very beginning, which I could stand to review even though I know most of the basics. 

Set two: 

(1) I would prefer to work with a teacher who has experience working with highly motivated students who move through the curriculum at a fast pace. If not, I would prefer to have a teacher who is interested in having very highly motivated students.

(2) I would prefer to have a different teacher for the morning and afternoon sessions.

(3) I would prefer to only have these two teachers and not to change teachers frequently.

(4) I would like to live close to the school if possible.


First week: 24 hrs of clas time
Second week: 25 hrs
Third week: 29 hrs

Near B2 level by end, with some more advanced vocab but still lacking some basic vocab.
