GPT-Jargon

My own prompting system:

Please correct this essay to idiomatic dutch and provide in bold any correction you've made along with an explanation in square brackets... please translate this essay into french and give me the french copy...please take the top 10 rarest words from each essay and put them into json format along with the definition of that word in german
