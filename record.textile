6.29 Sanskrit lessons started on Monday of this week at Harvard. Structure/syntax/sandhi are abnormally difficult, but pace is reasonable. Difficulty concentrating earlier in the week, requiring lots of repetition. Goals will primarily be to load vocab far faster than typical course allows.
7.10 Tuesday of third week. Active vocab at end of week something like 50 words. Amazing how little one can learn. Manner of class facilitates fatigue/ennui. Better to structure study plan oneself, although there are interesting diversions in the context of class re: etymology, etc. Lethurgy has been overwhelmiing so far at Harvard -- largely an influence of other students.
7.11 Thesis due in a day and half. Lagging.
7.17 Finished mid-term. Did not do particularly well, as was exhausted (due to thesis) and fell behind. Not sure what the best means of moving forward are, but a major concentration of force needs to happen soon.
