-- observation: difficult to maintain >1000 words. Moving to "multimedia" but hard to review new vocab. Important to move to active vocab, and even more important (at this stage) to be able to rapidly conjugate verbs and use them in sentences. Generally speaking, I have failed to meet my higher objectives and would have ideally been at an active 2000 active vocab instead of the probably 1200 which I currently have. This is, however, extremely difficult to measure esp. given the many many cognates (and things which are not included, like numbers).  Probably need to devise a better system for measuring. Typical pattern: make plan, start with enthusiasm, get diverted (put enthusiasm into related side projects), end up exhausted.

ob: lots of time spend on rapid use of words and, esp. conjugation of verbs. I feel that at least the present, simple past (prossimo), and gerunds I am fairly rapid without many mistakes. I am also usually able to understand basic Italian conversations. I have purchased approximately 12 books in Italian and reviewed several. However, despite an increase in speed, I am not close to being able to keep up with native speakers. The primary limitation seems to be vocabulary, which, despite passive increase (from conversations and, esp. reading) does not include all of the normal necessary verbs and nouns. I think I must be more systematic here, although, as noted, I have not been keeping up with the online flashcard system. Another problem is not knowing what order to approach the grammar in. Although I am able to teach myself and memorize new grammar from the book, it is not always clear what is necessary at my current stage (for example, I memorized gerunds somewhat randomly). As noted to teacher in one-on-one class today, at the Goethe Institute I had the benefit of an orderly curriculum so that I could study the next level while in the current one (something I did), so as to move forward far more quickly than usually possible.
Sampling of supplementary purchased material:
   - Bhagavad Gita (tradd.) by Raphael
   - Fuoco di Acsesi by Raphael
   - Grammatica Italiana per tutti i concorsi (O-Key)
   - Letteratura Italiana dalle origini ai giorni nostri (O-Key) 
   - Selezione di Alberghi e Ristoranti in Italia (Michelin), 2004 
   - Asterix e Cleopatra (DVD)

ob: Received approval to go to level 2 on monday. Have or will cover all material from level 1 by myself or in one-on-one sessions. Suspect it is better to learn more useful verbs early on. Annoyed that there is no clear rubric for success. Devising system for tracking all necessary parts of grammar.

Do1.22 ob: I believe I have official entered a "funk" of sorts, commencing more or less from when my apartment was robbed on Wed. night. My immediate sense of safety was compromised, my room rearranged somewhat and I have not yet put things in order. Additionally, the event coincided with a work deadline, and I have been struggling to finish work by previously arranged deadlines although not in the best of spirits. To get out of it, I have mainly been spending time with co-patriates (Americans), who have been most kind and accomodating, although I fear sleeping on the couch of another for a couple nights may also not be great for recovering my previous rhythm. In any case, both fatigue in a new place and depressive episodes are not terribly unusual, although the triggers in this case (doubling up on schoolwork, taking on additional work, fatigue from foreign stay, and an unexpected robbery) may be pushing me past my breaking point in an unusual and frightening way.

Sa1.28 ob: Finally finished work-related project at 11pm last night, taking rather more time than expected and meaning that I could not dedicate a lot of extra hours this past week to learning. However, as of today I believe I have resolved my long-standing and often considered problem regarding a way to track progress with respect to grammatical points, which I will provide in a new "key":italian/key.txt . 
Starting off at 0: "Grammar key record":current_status.txt
Level 2 is fine. Mixed quality of students as before, but good teaching.
