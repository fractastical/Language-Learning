6.29 Sanskrit lessons started on Monday of this week at Harvard. Structure/syntax/sandhi are abnormally difficult, but pace is reasonable. Difficulty concentrating earlier in the week, requiring lots of repetition. Goals will primarily be to load vocab far faster than typical course allows.
7.10 Tuesday of third week. Active vocab at end of week something like 50 words. Amazing how little one can learn. Manner of class facilitates fatigue/ennui. Better to structure study plan oneself, although there are interesting diversions in the context of class re: etymology, etc. Lethargy has been overwhelming so far at Harvard -- largely an influence of other students.
7.11 Thesis due in a day and half. Lagging.
7.17 Finished mid-term. Did not do particularly well, as was exhausted (due to thesis) and fell behind. Not sure what the best means of moving forward are, but a major concentration of force needs to happen soon.
7.24 Received permission not to attend class and to prepare on my own for the final. I will be putting resources together to this end. How I manage them I am not sure, but will put together my own plan.

Assessment of curriculum thus far:

  Perry, somewhat disorganized but nonetheless comprehensive presentation. Does not state what needs to be memorized and why, and with antiquated language. May still be best primer of its type, although not optimally suited for self-study as does not always fill in the gaps. Witzel uses many additional handouts, which would be too much to list. 



  Sandhi -> still not sure the best way to approach these. Memorizing all the rules seems necessary.


Main effort for next week and a half must be getting research together for Comp. Myth paper. Must put together my own Sanskrit "crash course" in meantime. Must include: 

   (1) massive vocab memorization, including *all* words in Perry
   (2) all grammar points in Perry, although not necessarily via Perry
   (3)
